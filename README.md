# Roulette

This piece of code is a partial implementation of the roulette game
that I wrote in Go to test some "intuition" about the game.

## Run

```go
go run cmd/demo/main.go
```

# Dev

## Architecture

I try to test some ideas from [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

## Tests

Only the part of the code that I needed is tested.
